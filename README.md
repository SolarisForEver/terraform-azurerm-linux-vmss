# terraform-azurerm-linux-vmss

## Description

If only defining one VMSS then use the native azurerm resources. It creating several then this module can reduce down the noise, especially of leveraging the default.

I NEED TO BE UPDATED

This Terraform module creates a VMSS. Uses the same defaults object as VMs to reduce down the variables required.

> This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and will definitely change. Currently only supports custom images, doesn't integrate with availability sets or application security groups.

## Example

> YEP, THAT WOULD BE NICE
